This files contains public domain libraries to create:

A linux application which writes values in a PipeIn CHOP compatible format.
A linux application which reads values from a PipeOut CHOP compatible format.

A small test program is supplied for each library.
The small test executable uses the library to output a pair of
coordinates traveling on the edge of a circle.

To test the application:

make -f Makefile.PPDOUT
cd test
make -f Makefile.pipeout

This should create an executable called pipeout.

Execute:

./pipeout /tmp/chop.pipe

Now enter houdini and enter a default PipeIn CHOP.

Once it is displayed, you should see two channels slowly oscillating
out of phase. Its values are being supplied by the pipein application.
If you export these values to an object it will trace the path
of a circle.

Alternatively, create the pipein application in a similiar fashion
and execute this instead of houdini to read the changing values.
